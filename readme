This task deals with detecting medicare fraud using machine learning algorithms. The dataset has both inpatient and outpatient data. Firstly, I combined the inpatient and outpatient data since they share almost all of the features and training a seperate model for each would not be much beneficial. I first did exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the features. By doing EDA on exisiting features, I concluded that the existing features were not of much use in their original form. Therefore, I used feature enginnering to create new features. I first created a StayDuration feature from the addmission date and discharge data as well as claimDuration feature from claim start data and claim end data. Afterwards, to understand the how columns like Beneficiary ID, Provider, Attending physician, Operating Physician and Other physician effect the result I aggregated the numerical data with respect to each of these columns. I also used combinations of these columns in order to explore if for example a particular physician is colluding with a particular provider or beneficiary or a provider is using a particular diagnosis code for commiting fraud. The dataset is biased since it has more non-fradulent samples than fradulent. To balance out the dataset I used SMOTE, which is a synthetic data generation technique.Finally,I have used RandomForest algorithm since it is robust to overfitting,performs really well and also easily interpretable
